title: The Fastest Bible Search on the Planet
---

Hi, I'm Johann, a Berlin based software developer and dad of two girls.

I wrote this fast Bible search tool in my spare time
and there are a few things I would like to improve or implement in the future:

- A fuzzy text search that tolerates typos and different spellings.
- Integrate more Bible texts!
- Improve Old English search (e.g. stemming worship/worshippeth, thou/you)
- Search for context, synonyms and commentary.
- Translate the search interface into different languages.
- Improve support for German umlauts, e.g. Ã¼ -> ue
- Import dictionaries for better search
- For some languages (e.g. Vietnamese) accented characters are important and the accents should not be ignored.
- Add support for Chinese and Arabic.
- Read the results in their context.
- ... any ideas? Send me an [email](philipp@stratha.us)!

You are welcome to support this project in any way! It will help me pause some of my freelancing to spend more time on this.
